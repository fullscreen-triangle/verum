# Ruzende: Inter-Module Communication Scripts

Ruzende are logical programming scripts that enable communication and coordination between different modules in the Verum autonomous driving system. They define protocols, data transformation patterns, and coordination logic.

## Overview

Ruzende scripts operate at the coordination layer, managing:
- **Module Communication**: Protocol definitions between Gusheshe, Izinyoka, Sighthound, etc.
- **Data Transformation**: Converting data formats between different system components
- **State Synchronization**: Ensuring consistent state across distributed modules
- **Event Coordination**: Managing event flows and triggers across the system

## Script Categories

### Communication Scripts (`comm/`)
Define communication protocols and message formats between modules.

### Transformation Scripts (`transform/`)
Handle data format conversions and semantic mappings between different representations.

### Control Flow Scripts (`control/`)
Manage execution flow, coordination patterns, and system-wide orchestration.

### Monitoring Scripts (`monitor/`)
Define monitoring, logging, and diagnostic communication patterns.

## Script Format

Ruzende scripts use a declarative syntax that combines:
- **Logical predicates** for condition matching
- **Pattern matching** for data structure handling
- **Temporal logic** for time-based coordination
- **Probabilistic assertions** for uncertainty handling

## Usage

Scripts are loaded by the Verum orchestrator and executed by the appropriate modules when communication events occur. They provide the "glue" that enables the hybrid reasoning engines to work together as a cohesive system.
