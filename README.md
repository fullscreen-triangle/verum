A comprehensive modular architecture for autonomous driving systems featuring hybrid reasoning engines, multi-model orchestration, and nanosecond-precision sensor fusion for real-time decision making.

## Overview

Verum represents a paradigm shift in autonomous driving systems, moving beyond traditional rule-based or purely statistical approaches to implement a sophisticated multi-layer architecture that combines:

- **Nanosecond-precision sensor timestamping** for atomic-level accuracy
- **Hybrid resolution engines** that resolve decisions through evidence debate
- **Multi-domain AI model orchestration** for specialized expertise integration  
- **Rigorous RAG systems** for knowledge-grounded reasoning during system dreaming
- **Extreme domain-expert LLMs** that communicate through prompting
- **High-performance microservices** for computational bottleneck elimination

### Core System Components

#### **Gusheshe**: Hybrid Resolution Engine
A debate-based decision engine that resolves conflicts through evidence aggregation rather than traditional rule-based systems. Combines logical, fuzzy, and Bayesian reasoning with real-time constraints (100ms default, 10ms emergency fallback).

#### **Izinyoka**: Metacognitive Orchestrator  
A biomimetic three-layer architecture (Context, Reasoning, Intuition) with metabolic processing cycles for streaming sensory data integration and pattern synthesis.

#### **Ruzende**: Inter-Module Communication Scripts
Logical programming scripts defining protocols and data exchange patterns throughout the system, enabling asynchronous coordination between all components.

#### **Sighthound**: Nanosecond-Precision Sensor Fusion
High-resolution geolocation reconstruction applying line-of-sight principles with atomic clock precision timing. Enables revolutionary behavioral timestamping where all sensor data (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, camera feeds) is synchronized to nanosecond precision.

#### **Combine Harvester**: Multi-Domain AI Integration
A sophisticated framework for orchestrating domain-expert LLMs through five architectural patterns: Router-Based Ensembles, Sequential Chains, Parallel Mixers, Hierarchical Systems, and Adaptive Orchestration. Enables true multi-domain expertise integration.

#### **Trebuchet**: High-Performance Microservices Orchestration
Rust-based microservices framework replacing Python/React performance bottlenecks with specialized services: Heihachi Audio Engine, Gospel NLP Service, Purpose Model Manager, and Model Router for intelligent AI model selection.

#### **Four-Sided Triangle**: Rigid RAG System for Dreaming
An 8-stage specialized pipeline with metacognitive orchestration for complex domain-expert knowledge extraction. Used during system "dreaming" phases when the vehicle is parked, providing sophisticated multi-model optimization and recursive reasoning.

#### **Purpose**: Extreme Domain-Expert LLM Framework
Advanced framework for creating domain-specific language models that embed knowledge in parameters rather than relying on retrieval. Supports medical, legal, financial, code, and mathematical specialization with knowledge distillation capabilities.

## System Architecture Philosophy

### Evidence-Based Decision Making
Unlike traditional autonomous systems that rely on hard-coded rules or black-box neural networks, Verum treats every decision as a resolution of debates between supporting and challenging evidence. Points (irreducible semantic content with uncertainty) are processed through Resolution platforms that aggregate Affirmations and Contentions using multiple strategies.

### Nanosecond Behavioral Intelligence
Through Sighthound's atomic precision timestamping, the system creates comprehensive behavioral models with satellite-timing accuracy. This enables:
- **Precise movement reconstruction** from multi-vendor wearable data
- **Predictive maintenance** based on micro-behavioral patterns  
- **Cross-domain learning** from walking, cycling, and driving behaviors
- **Emergency response optimization** through behavioral pattern recognition

### Dreaming During Idle
When parked, vehicles enter "dreaming" mode using the Four-Sided Triangle RAG system to:
- **Simulate scenario variations** from the previous day's encounters
- **Generate training data** through adversarial scenario generation
- **Optimize decision pathways** using recursive reasoning
- **Share experiences** by simulating encounters from other vehicles' perspectives

### Multi-Domain Expertise Integration  
The Combine Harvester framework enables the system to integrate specialized knowledge from multiple domains:
- **Biomechanics** for human movement prediction
- **Weather science** for environmental adaptation
- **Traffic engineering** for flow optimization
- **Psychology** for driver behavior modeling
- **Materials science** for vehicle dynamics

### LLM-to-LLM Communication
Following the principle that "it's better to have all models as LLMs and just have them prompt each other," the system uses Purpose-trained domain experts that communicate through sophisticated prompting protocols rather than traditional APIs.

## Technical Implementation

### Gusheshe Resolution Engine

```rust
use gusheshe::{Engine, Point, PointCategory, Confidence};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let engine = Engine::new();
    
    // Create a point with nanosecond timestamp from Sighthound
    let point = Point::builder()
        .content("safe to merge left")
        .confidence(Confidence::new(0.85))
        .category(PointCategory::Safety)
        .timestamp_ns(sighthound::atomic_timestamp())
        .build();
    
    // Resolve using hybrid reasoning
    let outcome = engine.resolve(point).await?;
    
    println!("Action: {:?}", outcome.action);
    println!("Confidence: {:.3}", outcome.confidence.value());
    println!("Reasoning: {}", outcome.reasoning);
    
    Ok(())
}
```

# Create router ensemble

    biomechanics_expert,
    weather_expert,
    traffic_expert
])

# Process multi-domain query
query = "Predict pedestrian crossing behavior in rainy conditions"
response = ensemble.process(query, integration_strategy="hierarchical")
```

### Four-Sided Triangle Dreaming System

from four_sided_triangle import MetacognitiveOrchestrator

# Initialize during vehicle parking
orchestrator = MetacognitiveOrchestrator(
    working_memory=True,
    process_monitor=True,

    "domain_knowledge_extraction",
    "parallel_reasoning",
    "solution_generation",

yesterday_scenarios = load_driving_scenarios("2024-01-15")
for scenario in yesterday_scenarios:
    variations = orchestrator.generate_variations(scenario, count=50)
    optimized_responses = pipeline.process_batch(variations)
