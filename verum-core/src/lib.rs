//! # Verum Personal Intelligence-Driven Navigation System
//! 
//! Revolutionary autonomous driving system that learns from 5+ years of cross-domain 
//! behavioral data (driving, tennis, cooking, walking, biometrics) to create personalized AI 
//! that drives exactly like the individual.
//! 
//! **Key Revolutionary Features:**
//! - **Atomic Clock Precision**: Nanosecond-accurate behavioral timestamping using GPS satellites
//! - **Cross-Domain Intelligence Transfer**: Tennis reflexes → Emergency driving maneuvers  
//! - **Early Signal Processing**: Acts on incomplete information like detecting "left" intention
//! - **Personality Preservation**: AI drives exactly like you while maintaining comfort zones
//! - **Automotive Industry Revolution**: Real-time vehicle health, predictive maintenance
//! - **Insurance Industry Revolution**: Transparent claims, fraud elimination, personalized pricing
//! - **Cross-Domain Classification**: Weighted hierarchical pattern access with microsecond response
//! 
//! ## Core Components
//! 
//! ### Intelligence Modules
//! - `specialized_agents`: Domain-expert AI agents (EmergencyResponseAgent, PrecisionControlAgent, etc.)
//! - `agent_orchestration`: Router-based ensembles, chain coordination, ensemble voting
//! - `metacognitive_orchestrator`: Three-layer concurrent processing with biomimetic cycles
//! - `cross_domain_classification`: Weighted hierarchical pattern classification system
//! 
//! ### Industry Revolution Modules  
//! - `automotive`: Real-time vehicle health monitoring, predictive maintenance, mechanic reports
//! - `insurance`: Transparent claims processing, fraud detection, personalized pricing
//! 
//! ### Supporting Systems
//! - `data`: Behavioral data structures, quantum pattern discovery, atomic precision timing
//! - `utils`: Error handling, result types, common utilities
//! - `verum_system`: Main system integration and demonstration capabilities
